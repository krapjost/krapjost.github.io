So i remove Redux from code and use Context API instead.\nOther codebase i contributed is console web client for storage management. It has a problem that data inconsistancy between server and client. So i added react-query library so that user can see the fresh data.\nEducation # Course What i\u0026rsquo;ve learned 2022 08 42 Seoul - picine Shell, C 2021 09 - 11 Like lion - startup school Django, Dart 2020 07 - 10 90factory - web development Web, Js Experiences in 42\nCan process strings via scripts like Awk and Sed. Knowing of file permission management in shell environment, Understands how data goes in and out from memory while writing C programs.\nExperiences in like lion\nSince i want to build something actually people use, So i had to research actively which tech stack to use. And throughout that process, became to have understanding for buliding blocks of web service.\nExperiences in 90factory\nI was able to understand what components the web environment consists of. And how javascript works in a brief manner. By building a simple full-stack service, I was able to experience everything from relational database modeling to MVC design patterns.\nProjects # Name One-liner Tech stack 2022 08 Love capsule Find someone who you used to love.

-  Experiences in namu software

    I was responsible for web front-end development for company that operates secure cloud storage sevice for enterprises.

    In the existing codebase uses Redux for global state management library,
    but i thought it brings unnecessary complexity for small service that only in charge of auth and service introduction.
    So i remove Redux from code and use Context API instead.

    Other codebase i contributed is console web client for storage management.
    It has a problem that data inconsistancy between server and client.
    So i added react-query library so that user can see the fresh data.
